# MACHINE-LEARNING-ALGORITHM-FOR-STROKE-DISEASE-CLASSIFICATION

## ABSTRACT
Stroke is the number one leading cause of mortality and obesity in many countries. This study preprocessing data to improve the image quality of CT scans of stroke patients by optimizing the quality of image to improve image results and to reduce noise, and also applying machine learning algorithms to classify the patients images into two sub-types of stroke disease, namely ischemic stroke and stroke haemorrhage. Eight machine learning algorithms are used in this study for stroke disease classification, namely K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP-NN), Deep Learning and Support Vector Machine. Our results show that Random Forest generates the highest level of accuracy (95.97%), along with precision values (94.39%), recall values (96.12%) and f1Measures (95.39%).
## EXISTING SYSTEM
Stroke patients commonly use Ayurvedic therapies, but there are no published data regarding the efficacy or safety of these therapies. Ayurvedic therapies lacks of accuracy to finding out the stroke disease 
## Disadvantages 
•	Lack of information about the disease.
•	Accuracy is low.
•	Handling cost is high.

## PROPOSED SYSTEM
For finding stroke disease classification, machine learning techniques are using in now a days that can improve the accuracy to finding out the stroke disease

## Advantages
•	Prediction results are maximum.
•	Accuracy is high.
## APPLICATIONS 
•	Dicom converter and micro dotcoms
•	Hospital appliances
